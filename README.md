# I'm Óscar
I work in product and platform: I design architectures, deploy infrastructure as code, and write backend/frontend with a focus on maintainability, security, and cost. Future CTO.

## Areas
- Cloud/DevOps: AWS (Organizations, Cognito, API GW, Lambda, CloudFront, S3, KMS, CloudTrail), Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions.
- Backend: Python (FastAPI/uvicorn), Node.js, GraphQL (Apollo), Java 17, Go (basic).
- Frontend: Angular, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Material.
- Mobile: Flutter (Hive, offline-first).
- Data/state: MongoDB, Postgres; Apollo cache + local persistence.
- Auth: OIDC/OAuth2, cookies vs tokens, PKCE, rotation, OIDC logout.
- Quality: automated testing, basic observability, automated CI/CD.

## Quick opinions
- Angular > React for large apps with small teams (consistency + tooling). Also a big fan of the Angular team.
- AWS > IaaS.
- Terraform > AWS CDK. Don’t get me wrong, CDK is fantastic, but I don’t require advanced services; I do need easy deployment across different clouds (Versatility).
- Nothing better than a good startup.

*-I like mentoring and helping others grow; I hold myself to high standards and expect the same from the teams I work with.-*
